  Local presence audit for brick-and-mortar, service-area, and multi-location businesses — the
  website signals that drive local-pack and "near me" visibility (GBP integration, NAP
  consistency, local-pack rank, citations, reviews via SE Ranking) PLUS the layer a website-only
  audit misses: whether the business actually runs a local content engine (GMB posting cadence
  and local social activity from Planable). Use when the user asks "local SEO", "GBP", "Google
  Business Profile", "NAP", "local pack", "citations", "near me", "service area",
  "multi-location SEO", or wants to know why local visibility is weak across site AND social.
  Requires both MCPs. Hands execution to marketing-local-campaign (city tracking + local posts).
  For the website-only local audit, use seo-local from the seo-skills plugin instead.

# Local presence audit

Score a local business against the signals that drive local-pack and "near me" visibility — GBP integration on the page, NAP consistency, on-page local intent, citation footprint on Tier-1 directories, review-platform presence, local-pack rank for the business's primary keywords — **and its local content activity**: is anything actually being published to GBP and local social channels? Deliverable is one prioritised fix list, anchored in observable signals across both surfaces.

> Adapted from [`AgriciDaniel/claude-seo`](https://github.com/AgriciDaniel/claude-seo)'s `seo-local` skill (MIT). Concept and dimension structure mirror the upstream; backend rewired to SE Ranking + Firecrawl + Google APIs. DataForSEO Maps geo-grid and Business Listings checks from the upstream are dropped (no equivalent backend) — see "Limitations" in the deliverable.

## Prerequisites

- SE Ranking MCP server connected (used for local-pack rank, on-page audit data, domain context).
- **Planable MCP** connected, with the business's workspace (for the local content activity slice).
- Claude's `WebFetch` tool available (used for sense-check fallback when Firecrawl is unavailable).
- User provides: (a) a target domain or homepage URL, (b) at least one primary local keyword (e.g. `"dentist Brooklyn"`, `"plumber near me"`), (c) target country and ideally city/region for local-pack scoping, (d) the Planable workspace. Optional: GBP listing URL, Yelp/Trustpilot URLs for review scraping.

## Process

1. **Validate target & preflight.**
   - Connector health: `DATA_getSubscription` (SE Ranking) + `list_workspaces` (Planable); stop and ask the user to reconnect if either fails.
   - Normalise the target (strip protocol from domain; confirm homepage is fetchable). Confirm at least one local keyword was provided — if none, infer from `<title>` + `<h1>` of the homepage; if still ambiguous, ask the user before continuing.
   - Estimated SE Ranking cost for this skill: ~15–25 credits (1 audit re-check + 3–5 SERP queries + 1 domain overview).
   - Firecrawl: optional with WebFetch fallback, ~6–9 Firecrawl credits if available (hard cap 12). When available, steps 4 (GBP-on-page audit), 5 (NAP extraction), and 7 (review scraping) run on the homepage + 5 sample pages + provided review URLs. Without Firecrawl those steps degrade to WebFetch-only — schema/JSON-LD detection and `tel:` / address element extraction become best-effort prose inspection. Pass `--no-firecrawl` to force WebFetch-only.

2. **Business-type detection**
   - Read homepage + `/contact` + footer prose (WebFetch markdown is enough for this).
   - Classify as one of:
     - **Brick-and-Mortar** — visible street address, "Visit us at", embedded Maps iframe.
     - **Service Area Business (SAB)** — no street address, "serving {region}", "we come to you", `areaServed` in schema without `address.streetAddress`.
     - **Hybrid** — both signals present (e.g. showroom + service area).
   - This determines which checks apply downstream. SAB skips embedded-map and physical-address consistency. Record in `LOCAL-SEO-REPORT.md` "Snapshot".

3. **Industry-vertical detection**
   - From URL patterns (`/menu`, `/practice-areas`, `/listings`, `/inventory`), `<title>`, page prose, infer one of: Restaurant / Healthcare / Legal / Home Services / Real Estate / Automotive / Generic.
   - This routes citation-source recommendations and schema-subtype recommendations later — load `references/local-citation-sources.md` for the vertical's Tier-1 directories.

4. **GBP signals on the page** `mcp__firecrawl-mcp__firecrawl_scrape` (with `formats: ["rawHtml"]`)
   - Scrape homepage + `/contact` (or whichever page has the most local intent).
   - From `rawHtml` extract:
     - Embedded Google Maps iframe (`<iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?...">`) — record place ID if present.
     - Reviews widget / GBP rich snippet markup.
     - `aggregateRating` JSON-LD block (presence is the strongest signal that the site wants stars in SERPs).
     - Business hours visibility on page (open-at-search-time correlates with rank — Whitespark's #5 factor).
     - Click-to-call: count of `<a href="tel:...">` elements.
     - GBP profile link: any `<a href>` to `https://g.page/...` or `https://maps.app.goo.gl/...` or `https://www.google.com/maps/place/...`.
   - **If Firecrawl unavailable:** WebFetch markdown can detect a `tel:` link in some renderings but loses iframes and JSON-LD. Mark Maps embed / aggregateRating / GBP profile-link detection as `(skipped — Firecrawl required)`.

5. **NAP consistency** `mcp__firecrawl-mcp__firecrawl_scrape` on homepage + 5 sample pages
   - Sample pages: homepage, `/contact`, `/about`, plus 2 service or location pages (pick from sitemap or top traffic pages).
   - For each, extract:
     - **Visible NAP from rendered prose.** Address pattern (street + city + region + postal), phone (`tel:` href + display format), business name (logo alt, footer, schema `name`).
     - **NAP from JSON-LD.** Parse every `<script type="application/ld+json">` block. Pull `name`, `address.streetAddress`, `address.addressLocality`, `address.addressRegion`, `address.postalCode`, `telephone`.
   - **Compare across the 6 page samples + schema.** Any divergence (different phone format on the contact page vs homepage; "Suite 200" missing from one footer; schema phone in international format while page shows local format) → record in `nap-inconsistencies.csv`.
   - **Brick-and-mortar only:** if a Maps iframe is present, attempt to read the embedded address from the iframe URL (the place ID and address are URL-encoded). Compare to page/schema NAP. SAB skips this.
   - If `nap-inconsistencies.csv` is empty after the scan, write `nap-inconsistencies.csv` as a one-line file with header only and note "NAP consistent across {n} pages and schema" in `LOCAL-SEO-REPORT.md`.

6. **Local-pack rank tracking** `DATA_getSerpResults` with country/region filters
   - For each user-provided local keyword (or the 1–3 inferred from homepage):
     - Call `DATA_getSerpResults` with the user's country and the most specific region/city the API supports (use `DATA_getSerpLocations` first to confirm a valid location code if the user supplied a city).
     - Capture: top 10 organic, local-pack presence (yes/no), the 3 businesses in the local pack if shown (name, rating, review count), AIO presence.
     - Cross-check: is the target domain in the top 10 organic? Is the target business name in the local pack?
   - **Save the parsed result per keyword to `local-keywords.csv`** (columns: `keyword,country,location,local_pack_present,target_in_pack,target_pack_position,target_organic_position,top_pack_competitor_1,top_pack_competitor_2,top_pack_competitor_3`).
   - Note the local-pack-ads caveat: the SE Ranking SERP returns the AI/ads-modified pack as Google serves it. If the local pack shows ads, record that — local-pack ad density jumped from 1% to 22% of mobile US local searches in 2025–2026 per Sterling Sky.

7. **Reviews scraping** `mcp__firecrawl-mcp__firecrawl_scrape` on user-provided review URLs
   - **Inputs (user-provided, optional).** GBP listing URL (`https://www.google.com/maps/place/...`), Yelp business URL, Trustpilot business URL, BBB profile URL.
   - **For each provided URL:** scrape with `formats: ["rawHtml"]`. From the parsed DOM, extract: total review count, average rating, date of most recent review (review velocity proxy), count of owner responses on the most recent 10 reviews.
   - **Aggregate signals:**
     - Velocity: ≥1 new review in last 18 days = healthy (Sterling Sky 18-day rule). >21 days since last = "review cliff" risk.
     - Volume: <10 Google reviews flags below the magic threshold.
     - Star rating: 4.5+ matches consumer filtering thresholds (BrightLocal: 31% only consider 4.5+).
     - Owner-response rate on Google: <50% on recent 10 = engagement gap.
   - **If user provides no review URLs:** skip step 7 entirely. Note in `LOCAL-SEO-REPORT.md`: "Review platforms: not provided. To audit review health, re-run with `--reviews 'gbp_url,yelp_url,trustpilot_url'`." Don't try to discover them — review-URL discovery is a different problem (and the Maps API path is the one we don't have).

8. **On-page local-SEO audit** `DATA_getAuditReport` (existing audit) + `DATA_getIssuesByUrl` on the homepage
   - **Reuse the existing site audit if one is recent (<30 days, see `seo-technical-audit`).** Don't create a new audit just for local — the audit data already covers title-tag issues, missing schema, mobile usability, etc.
   - From the audit, surface the issues that bear on local SEO specifically:
     - Title / H1 missing primary city or service term.
     - Missing or invalid `LocalBusiness` JSON-LD.
     - Mobile usability issues (mobile = where "near me" happens).
     - Schema validation errors (broken `aggregateRating`, malformed `address`).
   - **Defer schema fixes to `seo-schema`.** This skill does NOT generate JSON-LD. If LocalBusiness schema is missing or broken, the deliverable says "Run `seo-schema` for paste-ready LocalBusiness markup with the correct industry subtype" — that's `seo-schema`'s job and reimplementing it here would duplicate work.

8b. **Local content activity slice (signature step)** — Planable
   - `list_pages(workspaceId)` — is a `googleMyBusiness` page connected at all? Which local social pages exist?
   - `list_posts` for the last ~90 days on the GMB + local pages: posting cadence (posts/month), how many posts are location-relevant (city names, offers, local events — judge meaning, not substrings), per-location coverage for multi-location businesses (labels like `mkt:local-<city>` make this trivial if `marketing-local-campaign` runs).
   - Verdict per surface: **active** (≥2 local posts/month), **dormant** (<1/month), **not connected** (no GMB page). GBP signals on the website with zero GBP posting is the most common local mismatch — a profile that looks alive to Google but publishes nothing.
   - This becomes the sixth dimension score and its own fix items ("connect GBP in Planable", "restore a 2×/month GBP cadence — marketing-local-campaign sets this up with rank tracking attached").

9. **Citation-presence sample (best-effort)** `WebSearch` (no API key cost)
   - For each Tier-1 directory in the vertical's list (load `references/local-citation-sources.md`), check whether the business has a listing using `site:{directory} "{business_name}"` queries via WebSearch.
   - **Cap at 8 directories** (Google, Yelp, Facebook, BBB, Apple Maps, Bing Places, plus 2 vertical-specific). Anything beyond is diminishing returns and the user can run their own audit.
   - Record in `LOCAL-SEO-REPORT.md` "Citations" section: detected / not detected per directory, plus the URL of the listing if found.
   - **Caveat to surface:** WebSearch hits are a *sample*, not a comprehensive audit. A "not detected" doesn't prove absence — it proves the listing didn't surface for that specific query. Recommend a paid citation-audit tool (Whitespark, BrightLocal, Yext) for definitive coverage.

10. **Synthesise** `LOCAL-SEO-REPORT.md`
   - Score the 5 local dimensions on the rubric below, list top fixes (Critical / High / Medium / Low), record limitations.
   - Apply the verdict heuristic — see Tips.

## Execution handoff
Run `marketing-local-campaign` to set up city-level rank tracking and restore the local content cadence (GBP + local social, labeled per city, measurable via marketing-campaign-impact).

## Limitations
This skill could NOT assess:
- **Geo-grid local-pack rank by lat/long.** Requires a Maps API (e.g. DataForSEO Maps geo-grid endpoint) we don't have. Workaround: pay for Local Falcon, GMB Crush, or BrightLocal Local Search Grid.
- **Comprehensive citation audit.** WebSearch sampling covers ~8 directories; full audits cover 50+. Use Whitespark, BrightLocal, or Yext.
- **GBP Insights data.** Requires GBP API access scoped to the listing owner. Ask the listing owner to export Insights and share.
- **Real-time local-pack rank tracking over time.** This skill is a snapshot. Use SE Ranking's project-level rank tracker (`PROJECT_runPositionCheck`) or pair with `seo-drift` for diff snapshots.
- **DataForSEO Business Listings.** Not in our backend; if the user needs it, they'd need to subscribe to DataForSEO directly.

## Tips

- Respect SE Ranking Data API rate limit: 10 requests per second. Pace the per-keyword `DATA_getSerpResults` calls sequentially.
- Call `DATA_getSubscription` before running to read the plan's remaining unit limits. ~15–25 SE Ranking credits typical, plus 6–12 Firecrawl credits when Firecrawl is installed.
- Verdict heuristic:
  - **STRONG**: composite ≥7/10, NAP consistent across all sampled pages, target in local pack on majority of keywords, valid LocalBusiness schema with industry-correct subtype, ≥10 Google reviews with healthy velocity.
  - **NEEDS WORK**: composite 4–6.9/10, OR 1+ NAP discrepancy, OR target out of local pack on majority of keywords. The "Top fixes" section is the deliverable here — most local-SEO audits land in this bucket.
  - **WEAK**: composite <4/10, OR no LocalBusiness schema and no NAP visible on page, OR target absent from local pack on every tracked keyword. Substantial work required across multiple dimensions.
- Don't generate LocalBusiness schema in this skill. **Always** defer to seo-skills' `seo-schema` for that — it has the rich-results validation and industry-subtype routing this skill doesn't replicate.
- Don't generate review URLs from search results. If the user didn't provide a Yelp/Trustpilot/BBB URL, skip review scraping and tell the user to provide URLs in a re-run. Discovering review URLs from a domain is unreliable.
- For multi-location sites with >5 locations, audit one location page per region rather than one per location — the local audit pattern repeats per location, so a sample establishes the baseline. If location-page quality variance is the suspected issue, pair with `seo-content-audit` on a sample of location pages.
- AI-search local context (ChatGPT, Perplexity, AI Overviews) is **not** this skill's job — pair with `marketing-ai-visibility-benchmark` (domain-level, with the social overlay) or seo-skills' `seo-geo` (URL-level) for AI-search local visibility.
- The 18-day review velocity rule (Sterling Sky) is the most actionable single number from review-platform analysis. If the most recent review is >21 days old, that's a leading indicator of upcoming local-pack rank drop — flag as Critical regardless of star rating.
- Citation directories per vertical: load `references/local-citation-sources.md`. The list is curated to the directories that move the needle (Tier 1 + vertical-specific), not the long tail.
- Pair with seo-skills' `seo-technical-audit` if site-wide technical-SEO issues surface in step 8 — this skill scopes to local-relevant findings, not the full audit.
- **Multi-location sites:** if `seo-content-audit`-style per-location quality checks are needed, that's seo-skills territory; this skill's job is the presence + activity picture and the handoff to `marketing-local-campaign`.
